# teevans Dotfiles

Welcome. Here be dragons. 

I don't pretend to take credit for all the awesome stuff here, but I do find it to be most useful for my work style. I use the Kitty terminal emulator, tmux, and neovim for most all editing. 

## Install
All files should live in your root folder under a dotfiles folder. Run the install script. Essentially it creates a bunch of symlinks to the right config file locations while keeping everything local. I've found this to be easier to manage long term than the [atlassian recomendation](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

```bash
# Install
cd ./dotfiles
chmod +x ./install
./install
# Profit
```
